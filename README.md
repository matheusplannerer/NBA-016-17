# Triple Doubles relations to winning
In the course 'Foundations of Sports Analytics', I got the opportunity to play with some data from the 71st NBA season (2016 - 2017). This made me nostalgic. I recall being mesmerized by Westbrook's feat, averaging a triple during a whole season does not happen everyday, actually, this only happened over 50 years ago, that's why he became that season's MVP. https://youtu.be/VCIKek1f-Hs?t=179

The triple-double is synonymous with an amazing performance, however by each season this once fleeting stat has become more common, because of that, the triple-double has lost its legendary status, as players seem to be chasing the stat line putting their box score above their team's win. At least it's something some of us, fans, think. 

The main perpetrator is Russell Westbrook, his methods to pile up stat lines often look more like a gimmick than anything else. But does that make the triple-double itself a gimmick? Has it lost its value?

1) Histories triple-doubles
- The first one
- How many there were by season before and after West's MVP season (compare to curry's impact on the 3pt)
- Today's player's stats (Luka Doncic, lowry, Sabonis...) compared to great old ones (Kobe, Mike...)
- Career leaders in the stat

2) Relation between the TD and the teams win

4) Is this relation causation or a correlation?
