# Triple Doubles relations to winning [In progress]
In the course 'Foundations of Sports Analytics', I got the opportunity to play with some data from the 71st NBA season (2016 - 2017). This made me nostalgic. I recall being mesmerized by Westbrook's feat, averaging a triple during a whole season does not happen everyday, actually, this only happened over 50 years ago, no wonder he became that season's MVP.

These are some fun facts about the triple-double:
- The first one recorded in league history was made by Andy Phillip (Philadelphia Warriors) on December 14, 1950, versus the Fort Wayne Pistons. He had 17 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists.

- Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook are the only players who averaged a triple-double in a single season.  During the 1961–62 season, Robertson averaged 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds, and 11.4 assists per game. Westbrook is the only player to achieve this feat multiple times, doing so in three consecutive seasons. Westbrook finished the 2016–17 season averaging 31.6 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 10.4 assists, and followed it up in 2017–18 with averages of 25.4 points, 10.1 rebounds, and 10.3 assists. In the 2018–19 season, Westbrook averaged 22.9 points, 11.1 rebounds and 10.7 assists per game. After refraining from doing so in the 2019-20 season, Westbrook, in his first season with the Washington Wizards, averaged 22.2 points, career-high 11.5 rebounds, and career-high 11.7 assists per game across 65 games in the 2020-21 season.

- The record for most triple-doubles in a single season belongs to Russ, in 2016–17 he recorded 42 triple-doubles

The triple-double is synonymous with an amazing performance, however by each season this once fleeting stat has become more common, because of that, the triple-double has lost its legendary status, as players seem to be chasing the stat line putting their box score above their team's win. At least it's something some of us, fans, think. 

The main perpetrator is Russell Westbrook, his methods to pile up stat lines often look more like a gimmick than anything else. But does that make the triple-double itself a gimmick? Has it lost its value?

1) Histories triple-doubles
- How many there were by season before and after West's MVP season (compare to curry's impact on the 3pt)
- Today's player's stats (Luka Doncic, lowry, Sabonis...) compared to great old ones (Kobe, Mike...)
- Career leaders in the stat

2) Relation between the TD and the teams win

4) Is this relation causation or a correlation?
